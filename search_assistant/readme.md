```yaml
openai:
  api_key: "your-real-api-key"
```

3️⃣ **Start the service**  
Run directly:  
```bash
python search_assistant/main.py
```
Or with Uvicorn:  
```bash
uvicorn search_assistant.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 1984
```

➡️ Access at: `http://localhost:1984`

### Try It Out  
Use the included example:  
```bash
python search_assistant/example_usage.py
```

Or call from your code:  
```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:1984/generate_summary",
    json={
        "most_relevant_windows": ["Climate data...", "Research findings..."],
        "query": "Explain climate change causes"
    }
)
print(response.json()["response"])
```

### When Things Go Wrong  
The service explains errors clearly when:
