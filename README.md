# 🌐 Tübingen Search Engine Project

Welcome! This repository contains the collaborative work of our team for the **Modern-Search-Engine Project** at the University of Tübingen.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Our goal is to design and implement a custom **search engine** that crawls and indexes **English-language content related to Tübingen**, processes queries, and presents results in an interactive, user-friendly interface.

This project is divided into the following components:

- **Web Crawling**: Discovering relevant English-language pages about Tübingen
- **Indexing**: Storing and organizing discovered documents for fast retrieval
- **Query Processing**: Supporting search functionality with a retrieval model innovation
- **Search Result Presentation**: Visualizing results interactively using D3.js
- **Performance Evaluation**: Generating batch outputs and participating in the live demo session
